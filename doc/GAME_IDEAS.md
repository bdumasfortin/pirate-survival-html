# Pirate Survival - Ideas and To-Do

## World and exploration
- More biomes (reef, swamp, volcanic, jungle) with unique resources.
- Island difficulty scaling by distance from spawn.
- Points of interest: shipwrecks, caves, ruins.
- Procedural ocean hazards (storms, reefs, currents).

## Crafting and progression
- Expanded recipes (tools, armor pieces, stations).
- Crafting stations: workbench, forge, cooking fire.
- Resource processing (smelting, cooking, drying).
- Tool tiers that affect gather speed/yield.

## Combat and PvE
- More enemies per biome with unique behaviors.
- Boss encounters with telegraphed attacks and loot tiers.
- Status effects (bleed, poison, slow).
- Ranged weapons and throwable items.

## Survival and systems
- Temperature or weather-driven survival modifiers.
- Armor stats and durability.
- Food variety with buffs/debuffs.
- Inventory upgrades (bags, chests).

## Co-op and meta
- Co-op networking (2-4 players).
- Shared bases and crafting stations.
- Rankings and milestones (days survived, bosses slain, rare loot).

## UI and UX
- Crafting filters and categories.
- Item tooltips with stats and flavor text.
- Minimap and map screen.

## Audio and presentation
- Ambient music and ocean SFX.
- UI sounds, combat hits, and gather feedback.
