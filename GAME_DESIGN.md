# Pirate Survival (Working Title) — Game Design Notes

## High-level concept
- Whimsical pirate survival game about rebuilding after a shipwreck.
- Single-player and co-op; no PvP.
- Short sessions but long-term progression via ship upgrades and island exploration.

## Core loop
- Scavenge: gather basic resources (wood, stone, fiber, food).
- Craft: tools, camp items, and ship parts.
- Explore: discover nearby isles and points of interest.
- Upgrade: improve the ship to reach farther islands.
- Survive: manage hunger, thirst, warmth, and morale.

## World structure
- Archipelago of small islands with distinct biomes and hazards.
- Shallow waters near shore; deeper sea lanes require upgrades.
- Procedural islands with handcrafted points of interest.

## Progression
- Ship tiers: raft -> dinghy -> sloop -> brig.
- Each tier unlocks new traversal range and cargo slots.
- Crew perks (co-op): each player can specialize (gatherer, builder, scout).

## Survival systems
- Hunger and thirst decrease over time.
- Warmth affected by weather and nighttime.
- Morale boosts from shelter, campfires, and rest.
- Long-term debuffs if needs are ignored (slower movement, reduced crafting).

## Crafting and building
- Simple recipes with escalating resource requirements.
- Buildable items: campfire, bedroll, storage, dock.
- Tools: axe, pick, fishing rod, shovel.

## Threats (PvE)
- Wildlife: crabs, boars, seabirds.
- Sea threats: reefs, storms, sharks.
- Night events: ghost lights, shipwreck spirits (light combat).

## Co-op and rankings
- Co-op up to 4 players, shared island progress.
- Rankings based on milestones (days survived, islands discovered, ship tier).
- Seasonal leaderboards with cosmetic rewards.

## Tone and art direction
- Bright, playful palette with chunky silhouettes.
- Friendly animations and expressive character faces.
- UI styled like a pirate journal and treasure map.

## Prototype focus (first milestone)
- One island + shallow sea band.
- Gather wood/stone/fiber.
- Craft axe and campfire.
- Hunger and thirst meters.
- Simple crab enemy with knockback.
- Raft upgrade to reach a second tiny island.
